#### Who are you? Talavera, Roxie, M. USA/ MP,  SFC (R)

#### As best you can, describe the field or industry you can see yourself working in as a technical writer. I am planning on going into the field of Department of Homeland Defense working for the FBI. 
So if I were a technical writer in this line of work, after some reseach I found that I would basically prepare executive speeches, articles/reports, briefing papers and reports,
presentations, possible marketing materials (for recruitment/ missions abroad), talking points that involve technical topics for executive audiences with very advers levels of understanding
the FBI activities. 

#### What genres of documents/texts do technical writers in this field produce? What do these look like?Locate and share, if possible, some samples or examples of this genre. The majority of the genre I would be providing as a technical writer in this field would 
be Top Secret Decumentation/texts, anything from TS to TS-C (Top Secres- Classified).

#### What genre of technical writing do you have sense you might want to practice explore? If different from above, what do these look like? If and only if I were a technical writer in this field, I would not want it to be 
a different lever or genre of writing.  I would want to practice and furthur explore this type of writing and documenting as this line of work intrigues me and it will get me where I want to go and closer back over seas for the real work.

#### What sorts of research tend to be associated with these genres? At this point, do you know the difference between quantitative and qualitative research? This kind of genre uses a little bit of both the quantitatative writing style approach (analysis, data, principles applying formula/ can get accurate numbers) 
and the qualitative approach (based on observation gathered, not based on number data, research concept/methods) all depending on the type of report or mission at hand for the writing needing to be documented.

#### Another way to approach this project is to think situationally. What situations do technical writers in your desired field tend to be responding to? How might we replicate this situation in the context of our class? I am not sure if we can replicate the situations that a technical writer in my field or this genre
would be able to be executed.  The situations technical writers in my desired field respond to terrorist type actions/attacks, investigations, at times high profiles, forensics, data mining/data analyzing (Big and Small Data), and criminal profiling.

#### Beyond your desired field or industry, what situtaions -- professional, academic, even personal -- are you currently involved in....From an academic stand point, other than this class I would have to guess, students majoring in digital/graphic disign, computer science/engineering, anything to
do with technology.  From a professional stand point, I am honestly not quite sure.  Maybe buisness executives, somewhere along those relms. I say that because so far this has been different from what the course description into technical writing actually words so it's all been confusing.

#### Given your responses to the above prompts -- what do you think? what are some possibilities for projects? 
So far this has been different from what the course description into technical writing actually words so it's all been confusing, so honestly, I don't have a clue for a possible class/group progject.
